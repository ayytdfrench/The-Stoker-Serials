# The Stoker Serials Project #

Created in Spring 2021, *The Stoker Serials: A Digital Edition of the Serialized Versions of Bram Stoker's* Dracula tracks and compares differences acoross five versions of the novel. *Dracula* was serialized in four U.S. newspapers in the early 1900s, and each version has unique changes to the text that affect its reading. These serials are for the most part unknown and have recieved little scholarly attention, so this project aims to provide ease of access for researchers looking to study these serials. This project uses the Versioning Machine 5.0 which lets users view the four versions alongside one another, as well as a fifth novel version for comparison to the original text format.
