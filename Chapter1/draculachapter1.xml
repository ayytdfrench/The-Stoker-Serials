                    We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I 
                    had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. 
                    (Mem., get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a national 
                    dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, 
                    I don't know how I should be able to get on without it.

                    in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some

                    just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains ; one of the 
                    wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of

                    fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz—the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye. Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each 
                    side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked 
                    each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for some little time; and at last we saw before us the

                    of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:

                    "That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot deceive me, my friend ; I know too much, and my horses are swift." As he spoke he smiled, 
                    and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger's

                    crossing himself. "Give me the Herr's luggage," said the driver; and with

                    any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn 
                    and went along another straight road. It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found 
                    that this was so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any protest would 
                    have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay.

                    Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on 
                    either side. Though we were in shelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we 
                    swept along. It grew colder and colder still, and fine powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The keen wind still 
                    carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us 
                    from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my

                    Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared 
                    into the darkness. I did not know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer ; but while I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word 
                    took his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, 
                    it is like a sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where 
                    the blue flame arose—it must have been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all—and gathering a few stones, formed them into some device. Once there 
                    appeared a strange optical effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but as the 
                    effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness. Then for a time there

                    At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream 
                    with fright. I could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the 
                    jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. 
                    They were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled. For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man 
                    feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import.

                    All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes 
                    that rolled in a way painful to see; but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, 
                    for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the calèche, hoping by the noise to 
                    scare the wolves from that side, so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, 
                    and looking

                    When I could see again the driver was climbing into the caleche, and the wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was 
                    afraid to speak or move. The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on ascending, 
                    with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in 
                    the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.
