                    had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. 
                    (Mem., get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a national 
                    dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, 
                    I don't know how I should be able to get on without it.

                    in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some

                    just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains ; one of the 
                    wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of
